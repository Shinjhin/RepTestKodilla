            <h1> Imagine Dragons ~ Enemy </h1>
            <p>
                I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows </br>
                For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground </br>
                I'm searching to behold the stories that are told   </br>
                When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <p>
                Tell you you're the greatest </br>
                But once you turn they hate us</br>
                Oh, the misery</br>
                Everybody wants to be my enemy</br>
                Spare the sympathy</br>
                Everybody wants to be my enemy</br>
                (Look out for yourself)</br>
                My enemy (look, look, look, look)</br>
                (Look out for yourself)</br>
                But I'm ready
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <p>
                Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall</br>
                And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called</br>
                I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time</br>
                When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic</br>
                Tell you you're the greatest</br>
                But once you turn they hate us</br>
                (Huh)
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <p>
                Oh, the misery</br>
                Everybody wants to be my enemy</br>
                Spare the sympathy</br>
                Everybody wants to be</br>
                My enemy (look, look, look, look)</br>
                (Look out for yourself)</br>
                My enemy (look, look, look, look) (yeah)</br>
                (Look out for yourself)
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="center">
            <p>
                Uh, look</br>
                Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me</br>
                I'm praying that somebody hope for me</br>
                I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be</br>
                P-posted, being a wreck of emotions</br>
                Ready to go whenever, just let me know</br>
                The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor</br>
                The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable</br>
                I'ma tell 'em hasta luego</br>
                They wanna plot on my trot to the top</br>
                I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut</br>
                I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe</br>
                And it matters more because I had it not</br>
                Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition</br>
                Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic</br>
                Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking</br>
                Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic</br>
                Batter, batter up, who the baddest?</br>
                It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
